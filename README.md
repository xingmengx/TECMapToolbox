This is Retrospective Analysis Toolbox for Ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) Maps. The toolbox consists of two parts, a feature extraction program and a transfer entropy calculator. The feature extraction program is capable of extracting characteristics of local TEC intensifications from global ionospheric TEC maps. The transfer entropy calculator is capable of quantifying solar and interplanetary driving of the extracted TEC intensifications. Please refer to manual for more information.
