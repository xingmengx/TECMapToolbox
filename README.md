This is Retrospective Analysis Toolbox for Ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) Maps. The toolbox consists of two parts, Feature Extraction Program and Transfer Entropy Calculator. Feature Extraction Program is capable of extracting characteristics of local TEC enhancement regions from global ionospheric TEC maps. Transfer Entropy Calculator is capable of quantifying solar and interplanetary driving of the extracted TEC enhancements. More information can be found in the user manual.
